/**
 * This 2019-2020 OpMode illustrates the basics of using the Vuforia localizer to determine
 * positioning and orientation of robot on the SKYSTONE FTC field.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code then combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * From the Audience perspective, the Red Alliance station is on the right and the
 * Blue Alliance Station is on the left.

 * Eight perimeter targets are distributed evenly around the four perimeter walls
 * Four Bridge targets are located on the bridge uprights.
 * Refer to the Field Setup manual for more specific location details
 *
 * A final calculation then uses the location of the camera on the robot to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * @see VuforiaLocalizer
 * @see VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener
 * see  skystone/doc/tutorial/FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.
