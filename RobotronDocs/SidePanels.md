# Side Panels #

For the first competition we went to, we didn't use any outer covering and were informed that our robot had many sharp edges. To solve this problem we decided to cover the sides and the back of our robot with clear plastic. This also left us a good spot to place our team number and alliance markers. Also it protects the inside of our robot if another robot hits it or something.

## Numbers ##

We made our numbers 3 inches tall and 0.5 inches wide so they would be easy to read. We made our stickers by printing out numbers in the desired size, cutting them out, and tracing them onto red tape that we placed on other paper. We then peeled off the red tape numbers and put them onto our side panels. We were advised at the competition to put a background behind our numbers so they would be even easier to read than if its on a clear surface and we will take that into account.  


## Alliance Markers ##

We decided to place our alliance markers on the corners of the side plates closest to the back. 







NOW WHAT
