## Objectives ##

**Main goals**

- Keep the hubs safe

 Keeping the hubs in between pieces and centered will ensure that collisions won't hurt it. The hubs are tightly secured together and the beams. There is also an area meant for the battery that uses a strap to keep it secure.


- No extra space

The hub is built in compactly. The original base had a beam in front of it; which we moved  (bottom image, right) , farther back so it doesn't waste space and stays in place.

- Stability

Using the holes already on the corners of the hub, we put screws in from the bottom hub through 3D printed pieces to connect the hubs together. (top image). We also printed other pieces to connect the hubs to the beams around it. (bottom image).

**3D printing process**

- used CAD to design pieces
- measured distances before starting to design
- printed in house
