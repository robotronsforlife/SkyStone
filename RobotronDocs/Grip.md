#Grip

We have a gripping mechanism at the end of our stackable arm. It has two servos connected to it so it can rotate, making it easier to grab the block and a servo that allows the gripper to grip the block and release the block once stacked. We have cut up rubber wheels to make sure our gripper doesn't slip.
