Main document to review in this site is the game manual. Game manual has two parts Part1 and Part2. Typically Part1 doesn't change. Part 2 gets updated each year for rules specific to the current year. 

Please read the game manual to get familiar with the rules. We will be referencing these rules throughout the competition. [Game manual 1](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/game-manual-part-1.pdf)

## GIT Help ##
Git is the system we use for source control. (Source control is the process used to make sure everyone works on the latest code, the code changes are documented so that we can go back in time if needed, etc.) [Git Help documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Source code is maintained at [www.github.com](https://www.github.com). 

## Electronic Components ##

Learning more about [Robot Wiring](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/robot-wiring-guide.pdf) This article is a must read this gives lots of pointers on how to wire the robot correctly.

The hub and other components are made by [RevRobotics](https://www.revrobotics.com)

Please go to this link to get familiar with the [Power System](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/electronics/motors-servos/). We use all these parts.

The [control system](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-for-ftc/electronics/control-system/) lists all the the components that we use. We currently use two [Expansion Hubs](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1153/). Next year we may switch to one [Control Hub](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1595/) and one [Expansion Hub](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1153/)

## Mechanical Parts ##
We buy our mechanical parts primarily from [GoBilda](https://www.gobilda.com/)

For our chassis we use this [Strafer Chassis Kit.](https://www.gobilda.com/strafer-chassis-kit/)

When you go to any part page, they also list how this specific part can be used with other parts available in their site to make useful components. We will try to download all the parts into Inventor and try to assemble them.
