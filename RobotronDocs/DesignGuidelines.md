# Design Guidelines #
As a team we brainstormed ideas on what we should apply to our design in Skystone. 

### Use mecanum wheels ###
Last year we used normal wheels and we found our self at a disadvantage being not able to move at the same speed as other robots. With this years challenge that needs speed and accuracy we thought that mecanum wheels were the way to go. 

### Motor and where we need power need not be closer ###
Another thing we learned from last year was to not connect the motors directly to the wheels. We found this to take up a lot of space and put a lot of pressure on the motors. For example this year to move the base we decided to used two rods of metal that can spin to lock on to the base. Instead of directly connecting it to the motor we use a gear that is connected to the motor. 

### The motor axle needs to be always protected ###
Instead of pulling the motor it is pulling the gear which will not damage the motor. 

### Utilize every cubic centimeter wisely ###
Another idea we changed from last year was having a bulky base. Last year we had a very stiff base which was very thick increased our weight a lot. In our new robot we made it light and nimble. We made an outline frame that is sturdy but also light. Last year we struggled to keep the weight under the limit. This year we can add what we want and not be scared of going over the limit.

### Switch to metrics system ###
We are using metric system as it is easy to visualize and is more accurate.

### Stick to parts from one manufacturer for majority of parts ### 
Last year we used parts from different manufactures which meant that all the holes did not line up making use to more work to make holes. This year we are using all parts from goBilda so the holes will line up.
