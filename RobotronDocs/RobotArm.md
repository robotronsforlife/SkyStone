bevel gear 
30 rpm
1:2 ratio

The arm uses 4 30 rpm DC motors connected to the base, with 2 servo motors at the claw. The motors are vertical and feed into bevel gears that have a 1:2 ratio. These gears are connected to wheels that are connected by a long axel spanning the width of the system. The wheels are connected to belts that stretch to wheels on an opposite axel. The two axels are connected by carbon fiber rods, which combine stability and light weight. The second axel connects with more belts and rods to make a third section. The last section of the arm is the claw. The claw has a wrist that can rotate the claw. This is powered by a servo motors. The 3 beams on the end can squeeze together to pick up a block. This is also powered by a servo motor.
