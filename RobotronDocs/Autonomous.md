# Autonomous Programs

##Skystone Programs
We have four variations of our skystone program. Two for the red side and two for the blue. On both sides, one of the programs park closer to the bridge, and one of the programs park closer to the edge. In our skystone programs we first detect one skystone and then park( OR WE MIGHT JUST DETECT TWO SKYSTONES and maybe not park )

## Puller Programs
We have four variations of our base puller program. Two for the red side and two for the blue. On both sides, one of the programs park closer to the bridge, and one of the programs park closer to the edge. We first go and latch onto the puller, then we turn the puller and slide to the building site at the same time. We then unlatch and we park on the line. 

## Encoders

Since in autonomous mode, we have to make the robot move a specific amount we used optical encoders so that the robot moved a certain distance instead of making it move a certain amount of time. We used optical encoders instead of motor encoders because as we are using mecanum wheels sometimes it slips and the encoder count isn't as accurate.
