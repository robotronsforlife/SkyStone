#Power Management#

## Battery Management ##

We have three batteries and we rotate charging so that that there is always one battery being used, one battery charging, and one battery fully charged. 

## Power Distribution ##

From our batteries the power flows to the Power Switch and then XT30 POWER DISTRIBUTION BLOCK.  Connected to the power distribution block we have a SERVO POWER MODULE. We also have a RESTIVE GROUNDING STRAP attached to our Distribution Block. Our EXPANSION HUB gets its power from the power distribution block so the motors have enough power to function.

##Power Distribution Block##
The Power distribution block helps us easily connect multiple devices(parts?) to our robot battery. The robot controller alone cannot provide enough power.


## Servo Power Module ##
The Servo Power Module lets us connect all our servos and give them enough power without using all of the outlets of the Power Distribution Blocks.


## Resistive Grounding Strap ##
The Resistive Grounding Strap safely grounds our robot's frame to prevent high-current discharges while still keeping the difference in charge between the robot electronics and the frame to a minimum.

## Powering the USB Camera
The robot hub and camera are connected to the Powered Hub. USB Camera needs additional power and the PowerBank provides the extra power.
